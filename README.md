A place where i'll start a recipe website

It seems as though i'm making a recipe blog...

The skills i'll demonstrate here, are the following :

HTML structure creation, along with CSS styling proficiency

In more words, I want to create cards for each recipes, make them responsive to other devices than my computer screen, and allow myself to click on them to interact. Wether it opens a pop-up or the recipe altogether is to be determined.

Let's get cooking these skills of mine!
